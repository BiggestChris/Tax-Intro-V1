        <h1>Employee</h1>
        <p>
            Ok, looks like you're going to be an employee! There's a bunch of legal definitions around what it means to be an employee,
            but we don't actually need to go through that right now. The important bit is that when your employer pays you each month
            they will give you a <b>Payslip</b>. And your employer will also <em>automatically deduct tax</em> from your earnings and pay it to HMRC on your behalf.
            This massively simplifies the process and the risk of you paying the wrong tax is significantly reduced!
        </p>

        <h2>Important points</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Keep your payslips!</b>
                <p>Your payslips are your record of how much tax you've paid throughout the year. If you ever need to recalculate tax, or have any income outside of work, you'll need to refer to this, so please keep hold of them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>You'll be charged and pay tax automatically</b>
                <p>In the UK, the Pay-As-You-Earn, or PAYE, scheme ensures that employers calculate your tax and pay contributions for your directly to HMRC, this means that you don't need to worry about having to save up any of your employment income to pay off income tax later.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Unless you earn a significant amount of money outside your employment (&lt;Â£1,000) then you will not need to fill in a self-assessment tax return</b>
                <p>One of the benefits of PAYE is you don't need to worry about filing a self-assessment form and doing a tax return. There will be exceptions, and as you become older there'll likely be activites you engage in that will have an impact.
                But if you are just entering the workforce then you likely do not need to worry about this for now.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <!--
        <p>
            It's still worth understanding how your payslip works, and importantly
            if you have any other sources of income, or change jobs or decide to work for yourself during the year it's important to understand how the tax you've paid so far is calculated.
        </p>

                        This is the total amount you are being paid by your employer - this is the same thing as your salary (albeit split up by month).
                        This is the number they likely quoted to you when you accepted the job! However, the important bit is that this isn't actually the number that hits your bank account.

                        This is the amount of income tax you need to pay. The important bit to remember is that this is calculated based upon your current income
                        extrapolated out <em>for the entire year</em>. This means that if working for 12 months means you would pay tax at a different rate, but you end up only working for 6 months,
                        then the tax is taken out now at the <em>higher rate</em>.

                        This is the amount of National Insurance contributions you have to pay as an employee. You don't need to know the small differences between NICs and Tax,
                        but the simplest way to look at it is that it is like an extra tax you pay on top of income tax. So whilst base rate income tax is 20%, the base rate NICs is 12%, so the lowest rate of actual
                        tax you're paying is closer to 32% rather than 20% when you think about your employment income.

                        This is in place to stop your employer effectively paying you in food/gifts/cars etc. rather than cash to avoid you paying tax! The likely tax benefits will be medical insurance provided by your employer, and a company car if you have that.
                        However, it will depend upon the employee benefits your employer offers and what the relevant treatment is for that.
