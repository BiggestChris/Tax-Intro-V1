        <h1>Employee</h1>
        <p>
            Ok, looks like you're going to be an employee! There's a bunch of legal definitions around what it means to be an employee,
            but we don't actually need to go through that right now. The important bit is that when your employer pays you each month
            they will give you a <b>Payslip</b>. And your employer will also <em>automatically deduct tax</em> from your earnings and pay it to HMRC on your behalf.
            This massively simplifies the process and the risk of you paying the wrong tax is significantly reduced!
        </p>
        <p>
            It's still worth understanding how this works, and importantly
            if you have any other sources of income, or change jobs or decide to work for yourself during the year it's important to understand how the tax you've paid so far is calculated.
        </p>

        <h2>What's on my payslip?</h2>

                    This is the amount of income tax you need to pay. The important bit to remember is that this is calculated based upon your current income
                    extrapolated out <em>for the entire year</em>. This means that if working for 12 months means you would pay tax at a different rate, but you end up only working for 6 months,
                    then the tax is taken out now at the <em>higher rate</em>.

                    This is the amount of National Insurance contributions you have to pay as an employee. You don't need to know the small differences between NICs and Tax,
                    but the simplest way to look at it is that it is like an extra tax you pay on top of income tax. So whilst base rate income tax is 20%, the base rate NICs is 12%, so the lowest rate of actual
                    tax you're paying is closer to 32% rather than 20% when you think about your employment income.
