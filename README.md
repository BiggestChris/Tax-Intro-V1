Summary:
This Webapp is designed to proactively advise people on what they will need to do regarding tax, specifically about how they might prepare for their self-assessment. For this MVP, only the 'Workforce' section is operational, and specifically the guidance for those who are going to be employed or self-employed.

The intention is that it currently functions as a questionnaire, and funnels the user to only relevant information. If there were more time, I'd look at potentially refactoring into a Python Flask app, and also the possibility of building tax trackers based upon financial inputs from users (and saving that state somewhere on a server).

Build notes:
The app has been built using HTML and JavaScript. Bootstrap has been utilised as a framework, and ChatGPT support was used for scripts in the HTML.
