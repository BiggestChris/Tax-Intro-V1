        <h1>Self-employed</h1>
        <p>
            Right, you will be undertaking self-employed work. This means you will need to fill out a self-assesment tax return, and you will also be responsible for keeping records of your income and business expenses (as some of those can be claimed back to reduce your tax bill).
            Make sure you have somewhere to store that information, whether you want to do it physically, or digitally is up to you. There are many tools available now to help you store these records digitally as well. This assumes you'll be functioning as what's called a 'Sole Trader', which means you
            are operating as a personal individual, and not through a Limited Company. You'll know if your operating through your own company or not (it's not easy to do accidentally), so if you're unsure then you're definitely a Sole Trader.
        </p>
        <h2>Self-assessment tax return</h2>
        <p>
            You will need to file a self-assessment tax return each year, the good news is that you will have quite a long period of time after the tax year ends to do this. The bad news is the form itself can be quite scary with lots of different categories and legal terms.
            The truth of the matter is that for the vast majority of people, they will not have to worry about those, so you can relax a bit. And if you file your tax return online, HMRC actually have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return" target="_blank">very handy questionnaire tool</a> to walk you through and only focus on the areas that are relevant.
            And if you make genuine mistakes filling out your tax return that's not the end of the world, you will have future years to correct those. So the best thing is just to focus on the straight-forward categories of what did you/your business earn, and what business expenses did you incur.

        <h2>Important points</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>As you are self-employed, you are expected to keep track and ring-fence the money you earn through income that will need to be paid for tax</b>
                <p>For every £1 you earn, you will likely need to pay tax on that, so you are responsible for keeping track of that, because that money will be needed to pay HMRC when the time comes. Accidentally spending it is not a valid defence for not being able to pay in the eyes of the law
                    (that actually can be considered Tax Evasion).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Register for self-assessment and get your UTR number</b>
                <p>As you will be filling in a self-assessment each year, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment" target="_blank">go ahead and register now</a>! In doing so, you'll get your UTR (Unique Tax Reference) number, which is useful in quoting in all your invoices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The tax year runs from 6th April one year to 5th April the following year</b>
                <p>Yes, it may seem like a slightly strange cut-off, but this is what is set in law. This means that you need to track all your earnings between this time period for any one year.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>You will need to file your self-assessment by 31st January for the preceding year</b>
                <p>For example, for the tax year of 6th April 2023 to 5th April 2024, you will need to submit a self-assessment by 31st January 2025.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>...but you don't need to wait right up until the deadline, you can submit any time <em>after</em> 5th April</b>
                <p>It's up to you to manage your own admin and deadlines, but you don't need to wait up until the last moment to file your tax return. Crucially, this also leaves you plenty of time to ensure you can meet the actual payment deadlines.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Watch out for Payment On Account!</b>
                <p>This can trip a lot of people up, especially the first time it is needed! If your tax bill is over £1,000, you may need to make a Payment On Account (PoA). This is where HMRC will ask you to pay portions of your next year's tax bill <em>in advance</em>.
                    You'll need to pay 50% of the amount of your previous year's bill by 31st January (on top of the previous year's bill) and then another 50% of that amount by 31st July. Essentially, it is assumed that your tax bill for the next year will be the same, and you're being asked to pay in advance.
                    any difference between what you have paid for the following year compared to your PoA will then be settled at the end.</p>
                <p>This means that you <b>need to budget ahead and assume that you'll pay an extra 50% of your current tax bill at 31st January and then at 31st July</b>. Long-term, these PoA will cancel out but just plan for it when you first reach the £1,000 threshold.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Keep track of invoices and receipts</b>
                <p>You are obligated to keep your records for the last 5 years, so do keep track of invoices and receipts. Whereever possible, try to ensure there is a paper or digital record of any paid work performed.</p>

            It's still worth understanding how your payslip works, and importantly
            if you have any other sources of income, or change jobs or decide to work for yourself during the year it's important to understand how the tax you've paid so far is calculated.

                        This is the amount of National Insurance contributions you have to pay as an employee. You don't need to know the small differences between NICs and Tax,
                        but the simplest way to look at it is that it is like an extra tax you pay on top of income tax. So whilst base rate income tax is 20%, the base rate NICs is 12%, so the lowest rate of actual
                        tax you're paying is closer to 32% rather than 20% when you think about your employment income.
