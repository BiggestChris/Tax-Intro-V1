        <h1>Self-employed</h1>
        <p>
            Right, you will be undertaking self-employed work. This means you will need to fill out a self-assesment tax return, and you will also be responsible for keeping records of your income and business expenses (as some of those can be claimed back to reduce your tax bill).
            Make sure you have somewhere to store that information, whether you want to do it physically, or digitally is up to you. There are many tools available now to help you store these records digitally as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            This assumes you'll be functioning as what's called a 'Sole Trader', which means you are operating as a personal individual, and not through a Limited Company. You'll know if your operating through your own company or not (it's not easy to do accidentally), so if you're unsure then you're definitely a Sole Trader.

        <h2>Important points</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>As you are self-employed, you are expected to keep track and ring-fence the money you earn through income that will need to be paid for tax</b>
                <p>For every £1 you earn, you will likely need to pay tax on that, so you are responsible for keeping track of that, because that money will be needed to pay HMRC when the time comes. Accidentally spending it is not a valid defence for not being able to pay in the eyes of the law
                (that actually can be considered Tax Evasion).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HMRC have created a great tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-ready-reckoner" target="_blank">estimate your tax bill if you're self-employed</a>. You can use this to budget for the tax you will need to pay.</li>
                    <li>And if you're really worried about accidentally spending it - <a href="https://www.marcus.co.uk/uk/en" target="_blank">then put aside money for tax as you earn it in an easy access savings account</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Watch out for Payment On Account!</b>
                <p>This can trip a lot of people up, especially the first time it is needed! If your tax bill is over £1,000, you may need to make a Payment On Account (PoA). This is where HMRC will ask you to pay portions of your next year's tax bill <em>in advance</em>.
                    You'll need to pay 50% of the amount of your previous year's bill by 31st January (on top of the previous year's bill) and then another 50% of that amount by 31st July. Essentially, it is assumed that your tax bill for the next year will be the same, and you're being asked to pay in advance.
                    any difference between what you have paid for the following year compared to your PoA will then be settled at the end.</p>
                <p>This means that you <b>need to budget ahead and assume that you'll pay an extra 50% of your current tax bill at 31st January and then at 31st July</b>. Long-term, these PoA will cancel out but just plan for it when you first reach the £1,000 threshold.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Keep track of invoices and receipts</b>
                <p>You are obligated to keep your records for the last 5 years, so do keep track of invoices and receipts. Whereever possible, try to ensure there is a paper or digital record of any paid work performed.</p>

        <h2>Self-assessment tax return</h2>
        <p>
            You will need to file a self-assessment tax return each year, the good news is that you will have quite a long period of time after the tax year ends to do this. The bad news is the form itself can be quite scary with lots of different categories and legal terms.
            The truth of the matter is that <em>for the vast majority of people they will not have to worry about all those categories</em>, so you can relax a bit. And if you file your tax return online, HMRC actually have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return" target="_blank">very handy questionnaire tool</a> to walk you through and only focus on the areas that are relevant.
            And if you make genuine mistakes filling out your tax return that's not the end of the world, you will have future years to correct those. So the best thing is just to focus on the straight-forward categories of what did you/your business earn, and what business expenses did you incur.
